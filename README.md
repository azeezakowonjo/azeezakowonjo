- 👋 Hi, I’m Azeez Akowonjo
- 👀 I’m interested in using sql, power bi, and python to interact with data and deduce meaningful insights from such data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more efficient ways to analyze financial and health data for optimal insights
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my project on covid data where i seek to deduce the impact of smoking on covid patients in the US, UK, India, South Africa. I will also check if geographies affect mortality as well.
